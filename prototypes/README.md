prototypes/

Place each discrete prototype under this folder. Each prototype should:
- Depend on shared tokens, styles, and registry from `../shared/` or root configs
- Include components, stories, MSW handlers, and a README using the handoff template
- Avoid importing from other prototypes

Suggested commands (from repo root):
- yarn proto <name> dev
- yarn proto <name> build
- yarn proto <name> shots

Getting started:
- See `../documents/START HERE.md`
- Scaffold: `../scripts/new-prototype.sh <name> <PRD_FILENAME>`
